Hints and samples on how to get not-so-well-documented or never-thought-before features to work in Concourse pipelines.

- [Running tasks with images on S3 for disconnected environments](docker-images-from-s3)

- [Make Concourse retrieve an older version of a resource](check-resource)


- [Run a task container with a user other than `root`](task-run-user)


- [Configure Concourse with an HTTP/HTTPS proxy](http-proxy-config)

- [Running tasks and resources without a Docker registry](docker-images-from-repo)
